### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Meets expectations

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

Excellent user stories *and* pseudo coding.

* __Technical Requirements__: Meets expectations

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Excellent job displaying the buttons dynamically (not hardcoded in the HTML). I would like to see you spend more time on CSS / styles in the future.
Let me know if you'd like to pair on that sometime this week.

* __Code Quality__: Meets expectations

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

[inline code comments](https://github.com/jshawl/hilarymasland-project1/commit/d3fc961245b6f6548f64fb5ba8fb8088df4facbf)

* __Problem Solving__: Meets expectations

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Excellent job again on the pseudo code. Let me know if you'd like to work through adding another trivia category or adding more functionality
to the scoring feature you currently have.
